# This file is a step by step documentation of how I did everything

## Step 1: ommunicating between the cell phone and the arduino

I used the tutorial from roboindia.com (https://roboindia.com/tutorials/bluetooth-terminal-android/)
to understand how HC-05 works (https://roboindia.com/tutorials/bluetooth-terminal-android/) and used this app as my phone interface to communicate with HC-05 (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frederikhauke.ArduTooth)

So, this was the result: https://github.com/Thiagodcfarias/controle-remoto-arduino/blob/main/steps/step_1/step_1.ino
